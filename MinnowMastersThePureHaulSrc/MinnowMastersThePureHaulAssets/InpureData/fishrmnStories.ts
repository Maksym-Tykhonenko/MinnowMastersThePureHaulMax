        title: "The Night of Silver Waves",
        text: "Last night, the sea glowed as if someone spilled a thousand silver coins across the water. I cast my line, but the fish didn’t bite. They just circled calmly, as if discussing something important. Maybe the ocean keeps secrets even from us fishermen."

        text: "One morning, a tiny minnow followed my boat all the way back to shore. I thought it was a coincidence—until it appeared again the next day. Such a small creature, yet it felt like a good-luck charm swimming by my side."

        title: "The Wind That Knew My Name",
        text: "Sitting on the pier, I heard the wind echo the creak of my boat. At first, I was startled. Then I realized—the sea talks to us sometimes, just not in words we’re used to."

        title: "The Lantern Glow",
        text: "My old lantern glows differently when a big fish is nearby. I’ve noticed it too many times to ignore. Maybe it’s warm metal reacting to excitement… or maybe some objects learn the habits of their owners."

        title: "Echo Under the Pier",
        text: "If you tap gently on the wooden planks of the pier, you’ll hear a faint echo. But it’s not yours. Something beneath taps back. Probably the crabs—keeping a steady beat for the ocean."

        title: "The Lost Hook",
        text: "I once lost my favorite fishing hook in the sea. A week later, I caught a fish—and there it was, lying beside its scales, as if the fish had been guarding it for me. Fishermen don’t lie about strange coincidences."

        title: "Storm Eyes",
        text: "Before a storm, the fish behave oddly. They come close to the shore, staring with their round, quiet eyes, almost warning: “Find shelter, friend.” I always listen. They understand the sky better than we do."

        title: "The Rope That Saved Me",
        text: "Once, the rope on my old boat tightened itself around a post even though I never touched it. Moments later, a strong wave hit—hard enough to slam the boat into rocks. The ocean works in mysterious ways… sometimes protective ones."

        title: "The Silent Morning",
        text: "There was a day when the sea went completely silent. No waves, no breeze, just endless stillness. I rowed far out and realized how small we are, floating on top of something so ancient and unknown."

        title: "Minnow Dreams",
        text: "They say if you fall asleep to the sound of waves, you might hear minnows whispering tiny stories. I did once. Maybe the ocean is just a million little voices sharing their dreams at night."
